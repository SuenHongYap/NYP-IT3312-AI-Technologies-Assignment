# NYP-IT3312-AI-Technologies-Assignment
This repository contains my codes for my AI Technologies Assignment 
In this individual assignment, you will perform image processing and implement Machine
Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to solve a classification problem in Computer
Vision (CV). You will then tune each model accordingly to improve the performance of your
models. Having acquired the fundamental understanding of these models, you will then explore
powerful AI services provided by Google Cloud Vision API and propose an application to solve
any problem relating to CV.
